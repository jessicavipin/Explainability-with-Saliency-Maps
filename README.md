# Explainability with Saliency maps
This project addresses the visualisation of image classification models, learnt us-
ing deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets), specifically using saliency maps.
5 sample images has been passed through saliency mapping function using pretrained models such as ResNet18,
ResNet50, VGG16 and a Custom CNN and their results have been analyzed.

Custom CNN was trained using the following dataset. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UmfIX7j37ZIE2krOb9Y3itMymZCGZuLA/view?usp=drive_link
